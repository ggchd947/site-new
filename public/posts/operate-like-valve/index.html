<p>Instead of rewarding head count under person (even though you say you aren&rsquo;t, everyone knows you are)</p>
<p>reward things done per unit of time per dollar spent. <strong>Reward efficiency</strong>, not bloatedness.</p>
<p>If you are the leader of a company, like, the leader, stop falling for people&rsquo;s bullshit. Trust your gut and act on it. Get rid of people who are not letting engineers engineer and sales people sell.</p>
<p>The fact that you&rsquo;re not taking advantage of opportunity X isn&rsquo;t a headcount problem. It&rsquo;s a creativity problem. If you don&rsquo;t let people hire they will solve that problem creatively. It&rsquo;s easier to hire bodies, yes. But it&rsquo;s just an engineering problem.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a ceo, don&rsquo;t give people root access to your company. You need ot vet every single hire personally.</p>
<p>Eugenio Pace / Matias Woloski of auth0 would meet every single new hire before series B. Every single one. If it imposes a limiter on your org growth, guess what: that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
