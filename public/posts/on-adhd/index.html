@yacineMTB real opinion about ADHD
the disease is made up. We are distributional humans and boxing in doesn&rsquo;t work. Just learn to cope with your weakness and play to your strengths. Giving your state a name and identifying with it is often just coping with your lack of agency to help.
I am not saying that you can&rsquo;t have problems that are so bad that you can barely live. Actually, this is me! I am so forgetful that it affects my life. But I just use my creativity to figure out ways to make systems that correct for it.">

<p>@yacineMTB real opinion about ADHD</p>
<p>the disease is made up. We are distributional humans and boxing in doesn&rsquo;t work. Just learn to cope with your weakness and play to your strengths. Giving your state a name and identifying with it is often just coping with your lack of agency to help.</p>
<p>I am not saying that you can&rsquo;t have problems that are so bad that you can barely live. Actually, this is me! I am so forgetful that it affects my life. But I just use my creativity to figure out ways to make systems that correct for it.</p>
<p>Since highschool (10th) grade and through university I would mostly skip every single class that I couldn&rsquo;t pay attention to. Why <strong>should</strong> I pay attention? Maybe your boring dumb ass class is the problem, not me</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t skip the good classes that interested me, that captured me</p>
<p>&ldquo;oh you must have gotten bad grades&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t because I&rsquo;m not a bitch</p>
<p>I figured out how to work around it. In hs gamed exams by grinding through past exams. I&rsquo;d seriously skip every class, and grind for a month and get an A.</p>
<p>Why <strong>should</strong> I pay attention, if I can do that?</p>
<p>You want me to sit through a dumb ass bird course elective in university? No, I&rsquo;ll just read it on Wikipedia the night before and bullshit the essays and get a C. Your made up bullshit class is bullshit. You know it, everyone knows it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll sit through my algorithms, combinatorics, and number theory classes. The professors aren&rsquo;t full of shit. They genuinely, genuinely care. I&rsquo;ll focus</p>
<p>I took a tech writing class, I thought it would be easy. It wasn&rsquo;t. The professor challenged me. So I attended and focused.</p>
<p>I struggle with internet addiction and not getting distracted. So I&rsquo;m doing something about it</p>
<p>My twitter bar:</p>
<p>I use an adblocker to remove all notifications alert. My messages. No notification link. Even the tab on the browser doesn&rsquo;t have it
<img src="/img/adhd/media.jpg" alt="adblock twttier"></p>
<p>I have trouble when I tab to chatgpt, and it takes too long. I get distracted and check emails, hnews, x dot come, messenger, signal. So I wrote an extension that uses a faster LLM right in my text editor. No tabbing necessary</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get good grades, I have ADHD&rdquo;</p>
<p>no dumbass, you just don&rsquo;t want to get good grades. Maybe there&rsquo;s a reason you don&rsquo;t want to get good grades. Pay attention to what you want, not what you&rsquo;re told you should want</p>
<p>You have a lot more control over your environment, your own mental state included, than you think. Do something about it!</p>
