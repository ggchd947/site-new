<p>That would be worth millions and should totally be doable with current tech.</p>
<ul>
<li>be interactive</li>
<li>run locally with whisper/llama.cpp</li>
<li>It should also suggest best practices as you go.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like an internal fillet in that location?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to my calculations, that lug will fail at 10kN, would you like me to properly size it?&rdquo;</p>
