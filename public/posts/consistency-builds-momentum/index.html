    <p>An underappreciated aspect of productivity: <strong>momentum.</strong></p>
<p>The more stuff you do the easier it becomes to do stuff (literally anything). And inversely.</p>
<p>The idea here is that doing something difficult/high-effort has a high mental <strong>activation energy</strong> (separate from the energy needed to actually doing it).</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re only sparsely active, you have to pay this price every time, which is inefficient, painful, and actually disincentivizes you from doing things &ndash; leading to <strong>procrastination.</strong></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re always active, you never have to pay this price, making it dramatically easier and less mentally draining to do pretty much anything.</p>
