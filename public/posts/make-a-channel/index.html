Bro look at 3blue1brown or w/e his name is vids. It&rsquo;s very OMG MATH soooo beutifuuul kind of cringe but take from it important things like a visual showcase. Make your vids visual and speak to the viewer but in less cringe and you will do fine. I make these vids all the time btw just I don&rsquo;t post them, many of them do well one of them paid my rent in NY for 3 months and is still growing. It takes a long time to make a channel.">

<p>All you guys should be making channels, vids, whatever it&rsquo;s how you learn because then you have dive deep into the material. All the existing vids are pure trash.</p>
<p>Like nobody has a good big-O video, none of them understand it.</p>
<p>Nobody has a good amortized video either</p>
<p>Nobody has a language based Big-O video, it&rsquo;s important for parallel &hellip; that means not based on RAM model or w/e other bullshit model. Let&rsquo;s be honest writes are not going to be O(1) soon because they will be in some cloud.</p>
