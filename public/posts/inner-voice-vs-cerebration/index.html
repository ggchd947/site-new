   <meta name="description" content="The virgin Internal voice

Thinking speed is limited to his internal speech
Squeaky internal voice
Has to imagine a voice talking in his head when he reads
Accidentally thinks out loud
Spews whatever comes first in an argument
Understand abstract concepts only if he has the words for them
Cannot comprehend that people can think without an inner voice
Anyone with a mind-reading device can tell what he is thinking
Would bring nothing of value to a telepathic hive mind

The Chad Cerebration

Can think as fast as his brain allows him to
Complex and indescribable thought patterns
Lightning-fast reading, understand sentences as soon as he sees them
Silent and mysterious, always appear deep in thought
Choose his words carefully as to express his complex thoughts accurately
Can understand abstract concepts that are beyond human speech
Can use an inner voice but doesn&rsquo;t, because he knows it&rsquo;s inefficient
Immune to mind-reading
Telepathic hive mind superstar
