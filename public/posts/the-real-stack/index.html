    <p>few people cross between the CS/EE/MechE worlds.</p>
<p>with robotics ascendant, spend time with at least one of those 3 fields outside their own (MechE in my case)</p>
<p>that triple threat is sometimes like a superpower, because now you&rsquo;re a system of systems person, and can design just about anything you want</p>
<p>learn the fabrication side.</p>
<p>learn CS infra, EE physical design and assembly, and things like 3D printing, machining, welding, and other processes.</p>
<p>now you at least know how to DFM (design for manufacturing).</p>
<p>to top it off, learn something about manufacturing itself. BOMS, supply chain, provisioning, etc.</p>
<p>you call yourself full-stack? what I just described is the real stack.</p>
