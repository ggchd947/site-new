<p>The reason I&rsquo;m spending every spare hour I have in mechanical design and robot design / manufacturing is because it&rsquo;s obvious to me that the software for useful robots at home has been solved</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that a robot that goes around your home and picks up things left on the floor and leaves it in a container is hard at all to build and it would be incredibly useful. Or a robot that patrols my lawn and physically mangles baby weeds</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just new skills to pick up. Unfortunately hardware folks use limiting proprietary software as they have no software skills and don&rsquo;t know any better, but openscad (and libfive if I need to) just works and I can start pumping out designs if I keep on hacking</p>
<p>The main thing is that I&rsquo;m actually building stuff in general. I just gotta keep my 3d printer PLA and the openscad scripts flowing</p>
<h3 id="the-redpill-on-robotics">The redpill on Robotics</h3>
<p>don&rsquo;t let them fool you, the software has already been solved</p>
<p>pay attention, focus on the thing that actually matters</p>
<p><strong>designing</strong> robots to be <strong>cheap</strong>, and <strong>manufacturing</strong> them at <strong>scale</strong></p>
<p>going from arbitrary robot prototype to control software has been solved.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m literally screaming this, in your face. Do you understand what that means?</p>
<p><strong>The only differential now is the ability to prototype and build robots, fast</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about making money. I&rsquo;m talking about if you want to be a human who has a will to power. If you are looking to maximize your ability to manipulate the world around you, learn how to build robots independently without dependencies</p>
<p>load up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCli_RJkGWfZvw4IlDLHNCQg/videos">thang010146</a> and start learning. This is not a recommendation, this is a warning</p>
<p>you could literally build a useful robot out of cardboard. do you understand what I&rsquo;m saying???</p>
<p>there is literally <strong>ZERO REASON</strong> robots should cost more than 40 dollars</p>
<p>make it out of <strong>DOMINOS PIZZA BOXES</strong></p>
