I&rsquo;m archiving this x by Shahid Kamal Ahmad as I don&rsquo;t have or use twitter/X.
His 10 reasons for why 1984 to 1986 were the most magical years of his time in video games really show the difference between productivity programmers back then had and today, and what their environment looked like. I want to learn and apply these reasons.
10 Reasons

It didn&rsquo;t take very long to make a game. A month, two, maybe three, but rarely longer than six.
No deviation on the pure concept because of outside influence, either from customers or publishers.
No Internet, so no hate on your early demos, and no hate mobs for your finished game. If I did the The Comet Game today, I&rsquo;d be screwed forever. Also, no Internet feedback meant you stayed the course to find out and so you actually shipped.
No online component necessary, no, or very limited post launch support required, so no planning for stuff that doesn&rsquo;t matter for the 90% of games that don&rsquo;t make it commercially. The cost of failure was low.
Your finished game was your pitch, so you weren&rsquo;t wasting a year as Dunning-Kruger publishers &ldquo;uhmd&rdquo; and &ldquo;ahhhd&rdquo; over whether they should sign you or not. It was yes or no. And you moved on to someone else. If it was done and half decent, someone would publish.
No Internet, so I didn&rsquo;t waste time asking Twitter what game I should make. I either made something or I didn&rsquo;t. And once I did, if someone didn&rsquo;t publish my game, I&rsquo;d do what my mom suggested and just mark another one. Since it didn&rsquo;t take too long, it wasn&rsquo;t the end.
No middleware, all assembler, all technical limitations known and addressable through creativity. Therefore no paralysis through infinite choice of which latest shiny sexy tech stack to use and no switching. It was you, 6502 and hard work.
I was young. No family to support, no rent, and despite type 1 diabetes, I thought I was invincible and often tested this to the limit, almost dying on several occasions. This game me insane drive and unbroken time. 72 hour sessions were a thing. It wasn&rsquo;t crunch. It was love.
Only four channels of telly (Channel 4 was new) and no Internet meant no distractions apart from playing games with my dear friends Geoff and David. Inspiration and ideation came from long walks through my beloved London.
The video games scene was new and I was young. Life was opening up and the world was opening up. Tech was improving at an insane rate and I was up there with some of the best in my field by 1986. Earning money also opened my world up. Money gives you options.
