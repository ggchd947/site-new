<li>underestimate the likelihood of success for &ldquo;bad&rdquo; plans that could work</li>
<li>overestimate the likelihood of success for sure-thing plans (day-to-day is usually more chaotic than we expect)</li>
</ul>
<p>Free yourself from the requirements that your ideas must be good. All that matters is that they&rsquo;re possible. It could work.</p>
