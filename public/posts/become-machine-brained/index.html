Lots of people asking in comments on my recent post how they can &ldquo;study MechE&rdquo;
I get it, there&rsquo;s a degree in MechE so that means you can study it. And yeah, go get some books on heat transfer, dynamics, etc. Basically just go look at the standard MechE curriculum.
But. There&rsquo;s another aspect I&rsquo;ll call being &ldquo;machine brained&rdquo;. In general, basic materials combined with a foundation in physics and practical CAD / process knowledge will get you pretty far.">

<p>I get it, there&rsquo;s a degree in MechE so that means you can study it. And yeah, go get some books on heat transfer, dynamics, etc. Basically just go look at the standard MechE curriculum.</p>
<p>But. There&rsquo;s another aspect I&rsquo;ll call being &ldquo;machine brained&rdquo;. In general, <strong>basic materials</strong> combined with a <strong>foundation in physics</strong> and <strong>practical CAD / process knowledge</strong> will get you pretty far.</p>
<p>You can get a lot of this practically but only if you&rsquo;re the type of person who goes down the rabbit hole. If you&rsquo;re the guy that halfasses a project to get a basic result you&rsquo;ll have a harder time.</p>
<p>I guess my best advice for becoming machine brained is to hang around others who are. If you&rsquo;re in school still, go hang out at your institution&rsquo;s student machine shop. If not, make some friends in the field and start a project with them.</p>
<p>Anything that gets you building around others that know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Oh, and steal a McMaster-Carr catalog.</p>
