    <h1>Fuck Waiting</h1>

    

    <p>Let me guess, you&rsquo;re waiting to act on that idea that you&rsquo;ve had for years. There comes a time when dreaming feels more rewarding than actually working on that dream. Thinking to yourself one day you will live up to your potential not knowing you are asleep and your dream is slowly dying. Sometimes it takes waking up to start working on those dreams. <strong>Wake up. Now.</strong></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve told everyone you&rsquo;re locked in, only on the surface, but you&rsquo;re avoiding it, and you know it. Your soul is in anguish. <strong>Only working on your dreams will get you to your dreams.</strong> Supplements can help or be used as a useful distraction, you&rsquo;re moving just enough but not going anywhere. Which is worse.</p>
<p>Comfortable excuses to stay in your comfort zone, we tell ourselves these lies to justify inaction. <strong>But comfort is the enemy of greatness.</strong> Your dreams don&rsquo;t care about your excuses. They&rsquo;re screaming for attention, begging to be brought into reality. The universe keeps giving you hints but you keep ignoring. Eventually, like you, the universe will give up trying to manifest your dreams.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not getting any younger. The world isn&rsquo;t pausing its rapid evolution for you to catch up. Every second you spend waiting is a second lost. Time is the one resource you can never get back. Look around you. The successful people you so much look up to? <strong>They didn&rsquo;t wait.</strong> They fumbled. They failed. But they kept going, iterating. They understood that <strong>imperfect action trumps perfect inaction</strong> every single time.</p>
<p><strong>Stop planning. Start Attacking. Start doing.</strong> Your plan doesn&rsquo;t need to be perfect. It needs to be in motion. <a href="/posts/consistency-builds-momentum/">Momentum</a> is your friend. <strong>Once you start moving, the path becomes clearer.</strong> Opportunities you never imagined will present themselves. Opportunities unfold and multiply as you seize them.</p>
<p>The cost of waiting is higher than you think. It&rsquo;s not just time lost. It&rsquo;s experiences felt, connections made, lives touched. <strong>Your unrealized potential is a burden not just to you, but the world that needs what only you can offer.</strong> Your talent is a gift <strong>ordained by GOD</strong>. It becomes an offence if you do not embrace it.</p>
<p>Grow, learn, evolve. <strong>The time to act is now.</strong> Not tomorrow. Not next week. Not when you feel &ldquo;ready&rdquo;. Now. This very moment. As you read these words, opportunities are slipping through your fingers like sand. Remember, on your deathbed, <strong>you won&rsquo;t regret the failures.</strong> <strong>You&rsquo;ll regret the chances you didn&rsquo;t take, the dreams you didn&rsquo;t pursue, the life you didn&rsquo;t dare to live fully.</strong> The perfect time is a lie. But this moment, right now, is real. And it&rsquo;s yours for the taking. Love to live. Don&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dvD6TOXY4">Quit Waiting</a></p>
<p>for those who don&rsquo;t wanna wait</p>
<p>go fast</p>
<p>do things <strong>NOW</strong></p>
<p>you will mess up it&rsquo;s an integral part of the process</p>
<p>do everything with aggressive velocity</p>
<p>the last thing you ever wanna do is doing nothing</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no perfect moment for anything</p>
<p>the perfect moment is <strong>NOW</strong></p>
