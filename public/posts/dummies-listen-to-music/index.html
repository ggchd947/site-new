<p>None of my intelligent (130+ IQ) friends listen to music regularly. They only listen selectively and rarely e.g. at a business event or a classical piece, but almost never listen spontaneously in their own time. This has been a long term consistent observation, but today confirmation came. A new meta-analysis showed time listening to music per day increases exponentially with lower IQ, with drop off to near 0 minutes at 145+. Music is mostly appealing as a way to fill an otherwise vacant mind that has no interesting thoughts and minimal goal-directed behavior. Intelligent people find stimulation from thinking about problems and doing things, not from marinading in vaguely pleasant sounds like a soggy potato sitting in oil in a dirty oven tray</p>
<p>People hate scientific findings like these because it threatens their ego</p>
<ul>
<li>They falsely see themselves as smart</li>
<li>They listen to music</li>
<li>Studies say opposite</li>
<li>Cope apocalypse ensues. Funnily, it directly proves low IQ by their inability to understand n=1 VS population results</li>
</ul>
<p>Just as funny are gloats in the opposite direction too</p>
<ul>
<li>Hasn’t listened to music lately</li>
<li>(Or maybe has, but nobody knows)</li>
<li>QTs or comments that they haven’t listened to music in years, and delightedly lets everyone infer the implications of unquestionable supreme intelligence</li>
</ul>
<p>To anyone persistently arguing with science, I also recommend listening to music</p>
<p>I’m sure it won’t take more than 2 minutes of listening to your favorite Taylor Swift songs before you forget all about this and shift back into the braindead delusional slumber you call your “life”</p>
<p>If you are too lazy to read the studies the fastest way to learn the average IQs of heavy-duty music listeners is to read the QTs/replies on the original thread. My DMs are also a potent insight. It’s natural to want to silence your mind with music if it is so full of bitterness and hate.
