7 year olds are bad at paying attention to your non interesting dogshit lesson where you are trying to drill them into rote memorization like little soldiers, while slowing down the brightest to the median
teach them actual useful math
you really had to learn coordinate systems 6 times in a row every year? of course they aren&rsquo;t paying attention. kids are smarter than you think and they are picking up on the underpaid teacher&rsquo;s nihilistic attitude and lack of understanding about mathematics">

<p>I didn&rsquo;t pay attention. I was motivated to get good grades because I&rsquo;m competitive. Did I actually learn? No! I wasn&rsquo;t interested in learning what was being taught! I just <em>solved</em> the <em>problem</em> at hand. Get top grades with little effort. There was nothing to learn!</p>
<p>Stop teaching kids ANYTHING that isn&rsquo;t mathematics. It&rsquo;s literally just a waste of time. English lessons? Qhahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahah ENGKISH LESSONS HAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHhhwahhahahaaha</p>
