you drink the same coke as a billionaire.


you use the same iphone as a billionaire on the same network.


you use the exact same tools as a billionaire, e.g. chatgpt &mdash; there is no special ultra rich person versions of software or apps.


you read the same garbage online as a billionaire.">

    <h1>Wealth Gap Shrinking</h1>

    

    <p>the gap between the very rich &amp; everyone else is actually shrinking drastically over time due to hyper capitalism + tech.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you drink the same coke as a billionaire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you use the same iphone as a billionaire on the same network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you use the exact same tools as a billionaire, e.g. chatgpt &mdash; there is no special ultra rich person versions of software or apps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you read the same garbage online as a billionaire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you post in the same fashion as a billionaire on the same networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a billionaire poops on the same type of toilet as you do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you’re afforded ~roughly the same healthcare as a billionaire (assuming you have insurance) with marginal differences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you can roughly go travel to any place just like a billionaire can (private vs not).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you can eat &amp; drink the same foods as a billionaire (e.g. go to a michelin star spot etc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you can wear the same clothing &amp; fashion accessories (or even get knockoff lookalikes for cheap).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you and the billionaire counterpart face the same problems with love &amp; relationships, in fact yours might be easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>being a billionaire likely comes with its own set of challenges that you don’t ever have to think or worry about.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>there are very few things you don’t truly have access to as capitalism &amp; sheer force of technology slowly make virtually anything into a commodity.</p>
<p>we truly live in a profoundly abundant &amp; accessible world &amp; it’s unclear if humans have the capacity to deal with abundance of this magnitude.</p>
<p>the kings / elites of past &amp; everyone else had a much wider gap in terms of access &amp; lifestyle… and perhaps were happier that way.</p>
