    <h1>IP and China</h1>

    

    <p>It&rsquo;s funny to see people cope about china destroying them competitively by using &ldquo;muh ip&rdquo;. I have seen your IP. It&rsquo;s not worth the paper it&rsquo;s written on. Blog posts by grad students have more value. There is no reason to even copy American IP because it isn&rsquo;t worth crap.

<p>The only thing that matters is production and utility. The industrialists before us understood this. Intellectual property is a misnomer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not intellectual property. There is no such thing. It&rsquo;s intellectual secrecy for your own benefit. Don&rsquo;t complain when you get scooped by the hard working Chinese. If you are smarter than them, why is there a bambu labs printer in every techies house in America?</p>
<p>If you think you are smarter than the Chinese, why have they completely cornered the 3D printer market and not you?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the value of your &lsquo;intellectual property&rsquo; if you don&rsquo;t produce product?</p>
<p>Where can I buy your robot? Oh I can&rsquo;t? Right. Because it&rsquo;s fake. And now you want to rent seek on actuators that a 16 year old Vietnamese mech kid could figure out in a day.</p>
<p><strong>You suck.</strong></p>
