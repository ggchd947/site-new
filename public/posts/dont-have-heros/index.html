    <h1>Dont Have Heros</h1>

    

    <p>sometimes hero worship can go a little too far - when you raise someone to the level of godhood, are you really just making up an excuse for yourself? for why you haven&rsquo;t done it yourself?</p>
<p>&ldquo;i just wasn&rsquo;t lucky enough to be gifted like them&rdquo;</p>
<p>the truth is: there is actually nothing different about John Carmack, Palmer Luckey, Elon Musk, Adrej Kaparthy and other great men of note, when comparing them to yourself. They don&rsquo;t have anything you don&rsquo;t have! Trust me!</p>
<p>you can do what they have done. you really can</p>
<p>you have something they didn&rsquo;t! their example</p>
<p>there really isn&rsquo;t anything different about your heroes &amp; yourself. you&rsquo;d know this if you paid attention. or if you just asked them directly</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i tend to follow the belief &ldquo;don&rsquo;t have heros, be a hero&rdquo;</p>
<p>try to be as good or better than those who inspire you</p>
