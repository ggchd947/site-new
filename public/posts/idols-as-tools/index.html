    <p>I think an issue with idolizing or glorifying people who are better than you at programming (or anything in general) is that you kind of limit your growth because in your mind their skill level is your end goal.</p>
<p>At times it may result in you thinking that their way of doing something is the &ldquo;best&rdquo; way and you can&rsquo;t somehow improve upon it, this goes hand in hand with self doubt e.g. &ldquo;Oh they did x this way so there&rsquo;s no way my method can be any better&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more nuance and it&rsquo;s very much case by case. Be inspired and definitely learn from those who are better/have more experience, but never glorify someone cause they also at some point had no clue about how anything worked.</p>
<p>You must desire to consume your idols and cast them away once the deed is done.</p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t a bar to reach, just a tool to use on the way.</p>
