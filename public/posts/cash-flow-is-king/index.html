    <h1>Cash Flow is King</h1>

    

    <p>Guy sells his $50K/mo business to a VC funded unicorn</p>
<p>Gets offered $10M for it, e.g. 16x multiple on revenue!</p>
<p>Too good to be true right? Well it is, cause it&rsquo;s just an acquihire</p>
<p>Celebrates it as a massive $10M acquisition</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look guys I made it! I&rsquo;m rich now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His startup is shutdown, and he gets paid a salary to work at the new company, with a vesting agreement that he has to stay on for 5 years to get the $10M, but the $10M is in stock valued at the arbitrary price when he got acquihired</p>
<p>Meanwhile that $10M stock gets diluted, the price may drop due to the market changing, and actually it might just end up worthless after paying tax on calling the options to buy the stock in the first place</p>
<p>And now you have a soul-sucking job at a unicorn instead of building a cool product</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re still poor</p>
<p>5 years of the bets years in your life wasted for quite low odds % on a pay out</p>
<p>You have no idea how many successful exits unfortunately pan out like this</p>
<p>listen to me</p>
