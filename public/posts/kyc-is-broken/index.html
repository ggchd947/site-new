<p>The banking system launders $5 trillion a year<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, that&rsquo;s 5% of GDP, criminals have a 99% success rate laundering money through the banks.</p>

<p>How about the liveness checks? Not only can AI know this over like a marshmellow in a hurricane, now you&rsquo;re forced to give even more of your biometric data to a third-party that once again can be purchased by criminals or the government.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s no real benefit in AML/KYC, they know it&rsquo;s a failed policy but they don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Maybe surveillance is the point.</p>
