    <p>AML/KYC is so broken.</p>
<p>The banking system launders $5 trillion a year<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, that&rsquo;s 5% of GDP, criminals have a 99% success rate laundering money through the banks.</p>
<p>In exchange for this colossal failure of a policy the entire world is required to give up all economic privacy while seeding vast honeypots of personal data to insecure third-parties which virtually guarantees their future identity theft.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re required to send your drivers license to more than 20 different organizations for AML/KYC - I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s available for sale in a dozen different databases along with every adult you know.</p>
<p>How about the liveness checks? Not only can AI know this over like a marshmellow in a hurricane, now you&rsquo;re forced to give even more of your biometric data to a third-party that once again can be purchased by criminals or the government.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s no real benefit in AML/KYC, they know it&rsquo;s a failed policy but they don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Maybe surveillance is the point.</p>
