    <p>the ego is the body.</p>
<p>you will have an ego as long as you live and this is a good thing as your ego exists to protect you.</p>
<p>when people talk about ego death they either mean a state of consciousness where you bypass your body or they mean shedding a maladaptive form of the ego.</p>
<p>many have a misconception &amp; believe enlightenment entails a form of ego death where the person remains completely detached from the material self, but this is a fallacy</p>
<p>you exist through your physical body</p>
<p>you are the glove &amp; the hand</p>
<p>you are the vessel &amp; the incarnate</p>
<hr>
<p>so you should love your self, truly.</p>
<p>strive to be better than everyone else</p>
<p>but do it by providing more value than anyone else</p>
<p>strive to perfect your physical form</p>
<p>because it will also effect your mental form</p>
