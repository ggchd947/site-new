@archived_videos: Genuine question, how to train your ability to see markets? I guess meeting more people would be one, doing more stuff another
@yacineMTB response

Literally anything is possible. You either need to skill up to the point where you are capable of building anything at all. Or, you just need to believe.
You need things. There are things that you wish existed. Just build that
Market it.

You have to think of it as an engineering problem. There is an event that you are trying to maximize. Honestly, one of the main reasons I got so good at this was reading the analyses of godlike conversion engineers at Stripe. As a result I now know it in my bones.">

<p>My repos folder on my afternoon laptop has like 2-3 things right now that I could launch and run a successful startup off of. Honestly after dingboard I realized how easy it was and kind of stopped feeling the urgency. It&rsquo;s so easy that I can do it anytime I decide to.</p>
<p>This took me 3 hours on a Saturday. I could blow out every single 8 digit VTuber company with this. It wouldn&rsquo;t even be that hard.

<p>We are kind of in a dot com internet moment right now. Except we already have the internet. It&rsquo;s on steroids.</p>
<p>I wish ya&rsquo;ll knew how easy it was.</p>
