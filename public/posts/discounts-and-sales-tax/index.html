    <h1>Discounts and Sales Tax</h1>

    

    <p>Discounts and sales tax are often computed based on a percentage:</p>
<ul>
<li>First convert each percent to a decimal by dividing by 100%.</li>
<li>Multiply the regular price of the item by the decimal value for the discount. This is the amount of the discount.</li>
<li>Subtract the amount of the discount from the regular price. This is the sale price.</li>
<li>If there is more than one item, add the sale prices together to get the subtotal.</li>
<li>Multiply the subtotal by the decimal value for the tax. This is the amount of the tax.</li>
<li>Add the amount of the tax to the subtotal. This is the total cost.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="example-1">Example 1.</h4>
<p>A backpack has a regular price of $20 in a state that does not charge a sales tax. A customer has a coupon for 35% off. What is the total cost of the purchase?</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert the discount rate to a decimal:
$$
\frac{35%}{100%} = 0.35
$$</li>
<li>Multiply \$20 by 0.35 to get the amount of the discount:
$$
{0.35 \cdot $20 = $7}
$$</li>
<li>Subtract \$7 from \$20 to get the sale price:
$$
{$20 - $7 = $13}
$$</li>
<li>Since there is no tax, <strong>$13 is the total cost.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="example-2">Example 2.</h4>
<p>A gallon of milk is priced at $4.50. It is not on sale. There is a sales tax of 4% on groceries. What is the total cost of the purchase?</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert the tax rate to a decimal:
$$
\frac{4%}{100%} = 0.04
$$</li>
<li>Multiply \$4.5 by 0.04 to get the amount of the tax:
$$
{0.04 \cdot $4.5 = $0.18}
$$</li>
<li>Add \$0.18 to \$4.5 to get the total cost:
$$
{$4.5 + $0.18 = $4.68}
$$</li>
<li><strong>$4.68 is the total cost.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="example-3">Example 3.</h4>
<p>A magnetic dry erase board has a regular price of $150. It is on sale for 20% off. There is a sales tax of 8%. What is the total cost of the purchase?</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert the discount and tax rates to  decimals:
$$
\frac{20%}{100%} = 0.2,\frac{8}{100%} = 0.08
$$</li>
<li>Multiply \$150 by 0.2 to get the amount of the discount:
$$
{0.2 \cdot $150 = $30}
$$</li>
<li>Subtract \$30 to \$150 to get the sale price:
$$
{$150 - $30 = $120}
$$</li>
<li>Multiply \$120 by 0.08 to get the amount of the tax:
$$
{0.08 \cdot $120 = $9.6}
$$</li>
<li>Add \$9.6 to \$120 to get the total cost:
$$
{$120 + $9.6 = $129.6}
$$</li>
<li><strong>$129.6 is the total cost.</strong></li>
</ul>
