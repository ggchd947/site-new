    <h1>The Climate Crisis Is Not About the Climate</h1>

    

    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>The definition of <strong>The Climate Change</strong> according to Google is: <strong>Human activities causing world temperatures to rise, with more intense heatwaves and rising sea-levels among the consequences.</strong> In elementary and middle school, we were told that we need to do our part in stopping climate change. Things like turn off lights you&rsquo;re not using, don&rsquo;t leave the sink running and RRR! (Reuse, Reduce, Recycle). But over the years, they started telling us that energy sources like oil, natural gas and even <strong>NUCLEAR ENERGY</strong> were non-renewable sources of energy, and we should do everything we can to avoid using them. Of course, that&rsquo;s impractical because these non-renewable source of energy are very vital for everyday life (except for nuclear energy, for now&hellip;).</p>
<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>
<p>Today, climate change is no longer called climate change. To make this &ldquo;problem&rdquo; seem worse than it is, they changed the name from <em>climate change</em> to <em>climate crisis</em>. This was done because <em><strong>&ldquo;Climate change is no longer considered to accurately reflect the seriousness of the overall situation&rdquo;</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="the-current-climate-crisis-narrative">The Current Climate Crisis Narrative</h3>
<p>This tweet by 24yo climate activist Clover Hogan demonstrates perfectly what the majority of &ldquo;climate activists&rdquo; or people &ldquo;concerned&rdquo; about climate change believe:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The most insidious form of climate denial is no longer, &quot;It&#39;s not happening,&quot; but the belief that incremental or tech solutions will solve this crisis. <br><br>1/6 <a href="https://t.co/l63Ug1Bfx9">pic.twitter.com/l63Ug1Bfx9</a></p>&mdash; Clover Hogan (@cloverhogan) <a href="https://twitter.com/cloverhogan/status/1783429995852964162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2024</a></blockquote>

</p>
<p>The purpose of the Climate Crisis Narrative is to justify authoritarian control over agriculture, transportation, industry, and speech.</p>
<p>The fact that these measures won&rsquo;t actually solve the threat of global warming is unimportant.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want a solution. They want power.

<p>She said it best here:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Sustainability&quot; should not the end goal; but the means to creating a more fair and equitable society.<br><br>6/6 <a href="https://t.co/IhLzlJqanE">pic.twitter.com/IhLzlJqanE</a></p>&mdash; Clover Hogan (@cloverhogan) <a href="https://twitter.com/cloverhogan/status/1783430004497408382?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2024</a></blockquote>

Translation: &ldquo;our goal is not to actually solve climate change but rather to install global communism where we are in power&rdquo;</p>
