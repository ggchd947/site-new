    <h1>Decline of The American Empire</h1>

    

    <p>Neither party can reverse the &ldquo;big cycle&rdquo; decline of the American empire</p>
<p>Democrats: Let in (low IQ) refugees! All people are the same</p>
<p>Republicans: Immigrants are taking our jobs! Jobs are finite</p>
<p><strong>Solution: Let in all (and only) people who produce more value than they consume</strong></p>
<p>America still has an ability to brain drain the world, but it&rsquo;s losing this ability fast.</p>
<p>tiny corp was not able to get visas for some incredibly bright people, so George Hotz exploring other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>If China were to open up this, there would be 0 question about the future.</p>
<p>This video is great  at making sense of how the empire cycle works. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xguam0TKMw8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xguam0TKMw8</a></p>
<p>Nice to see both the &ldquo;saying some refugees are low IQ is racist&rdquo; and &ldquo;preserve the heritage of America for white people&rdquo; types be offended.</p>
<p>America should be rich and prosperous, and we should follow truth to make that happen. If America is poor, I&rsquo;m peacing out ✌️</p>
<p>Also, the money needs to be fixed. Hard money only, nobody gets a printer.</p>
<p>Fix the money and immigration, and we&rsquo;ll have another American century.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t, and the party is over.</p>
<h3 id="voting-policy">Voting Policy</h3>
<p>I think you should only be allowed to vote if you paid more in taxes than you consumed. You should need to have a stake in the system to make decisions about it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we don&rsquo;t even have voter ID&hellip;so yea&hellip;enjoy the decline.</p>
<h3 id="merit-based">Merit Based</h3>
<p>America should be the promised land for people who want to produce more than they consume, and life should be very easy if you do that, and very hard if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
