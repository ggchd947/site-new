   <meta name="description" content="This is what 20 years worth of spent nuclear fuel looks like safely stored at the former Maine Yankee nuclear plant.
The energy produced from this fuel helped avoid 70 million metric tons of CO2 emissions.
Or 13.8 million home&rsquo;s electricity use for one year.


Please compare this to the waste from a 20 year old solar farm that has the same generation capacity.
90% of solar panels end up in landfills, because it takes way more time and 10-15x more money to recycle&hellip;
