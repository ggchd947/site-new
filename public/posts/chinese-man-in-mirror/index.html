There is a man in the mirror.
He is Chinese, from a humble family. He has his own place. He works out, and rolls his own cigarettes. He just finished a 14 hour work day. He closed business deals by meeting vendors that sold hardware in markets, walking around and giving out business cards. He does all of his own accounting, design, ML, software, customer service, and manufacturing. The manufacturing happens in his tiny apartment. His cost per unit is 100x smaller than yours. His funding? Non-existent. When he needs help, he hits up his cousins on WeChat.">

<p>There is a man in the mirror.</p>
<p>He is Chinese, from a humble family. He has his own place. He works out, and rolls his own cigarettes. He just finished a 14 hour work day. He closed business deals by meeting vendors that sold hardware in markets, walking around and giving out business cards. He does all of his own accounting, design, ML, software, customer service, and manufacturing. The manufacturing happens in his tiny apartment. His cost per unit is 100x smaller than yours. His funding? Non-existent. When he needs help, he hits up his cousins on WeChat.</p>
<h3 id="the-results">The Results?</h3>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to out-compete you in your home country, selling his units on Etsy.</p>
<p>Farmers in Ohio are going to buy his drones</p>
<p>White-collar workers are going to buy his <a href="shop.beekeeb.com">custom split keyboards</a></p>
<p>American manufacturers are going to buy his <a href="https://bambulab.com/en-us">3D printers</a></p>
<p>And rightly so, because you aren&rsquo;t half of the man in the mirror.</p>
<h3 id="western-embarrassment">Western Embarrassment</h3>
<p>This is the real embarrassment of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TitZV6k8zfA">Humane AI pin</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddTV12hErTc">Rabbit R1</a>. I feel embarrassed for the US. This is not the Western dynamism I know and love.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s return to early blizz, building undeniable products at undeniably lowly costs. That people want. Let&rsquo;s humble ourselves.</p>
<h3 id="be-better">Be Better</h3>
<p>The Chinese? Stealing our intellectual property? Our research?</p>
<p><strong>That&rsquo;s cope.</strong></p>
<p>They&rsquo;re simply learning from our best.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s learn from their best.</p>
