This man is a true genius and the most valuable Google engineer. He&rsquo;s like a god at Google and not even the CEO would go against him. He literally made Google what it is today and wrote/worked-on all of their most important software stacks. He&rsquo;s worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
Now, notice something interesting:
He doesn&rsquo;t  have two, three or four monitors and he doesn&rsquo;t have some gigantic TV screen that kills your focus and distracts him from everything important.">

This man is a true genius and the most valuable Google engineer. He&rsquo;s like a god at Google and not even the CEO would go against him. He literally made Google what it is today and wrote/worked-on all of their most important software stacks. He&rsquo;s worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Now, notice something interesting:</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t  have two, three or four monitors and he doesn&rsquo;t have some gigantic TV screen that kills your focus and distracts him from everything important.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have some bullshit meme mech keyboard with some special switches that were forged by elves in Japan from katana-grade steel and lights that emit perfect sRGB colors.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have a mouse with refresh rate so high that it breaks spacetime continuum every time you slide it across your desk.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have a $300 pair of audiophile grade headphones.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have some super-expensive chair with all kinds of knobs and adjustments that can even massage your prostate.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have some tricked out text editor with million different features and colors.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t run some super-autistic Linux distro like Arch that demands you babysit it all the time.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have some DE with customized CSS UI that you usually see in tons of threads on reddit.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t even change the default theme, colors or the default background.</p>
<p>He can afford all that shit, yet he doesn&rsquo;t waste his time on it. Instead, he writes 100x more lines of code than you and it 1,000,000x more accomplished than you&rsquo;ll ever be. And he&rsquo;s infinitely smarter than you&rsquo;ll ever be.</p>
<p>So quit falling for fucking memes and quit craving all the latest bullshit that gets posted online in these cancerous consumerist social media platforms that just make you feel inadequate. <strong>Just learn your craft and get better.</strong> What matters is what&rsquo;s in your head and how you express yourself and not what you have on your desk.</p>
