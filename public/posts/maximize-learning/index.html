    <p>If you want to maximize learning, you need to maximize the amount of mistakes you make. aim for like a 30/70 split of error to success. then, maximize by doing more things more often in smaller steps. focus on the count of total errors. don&rsquo;t stop. keep on doing things</p>
<p>we work pretty much exactly like neural network models of the world. focus on making errors, grounded by the truth you&rsquo;ve built so far. add resolution. add resolution. don&rsquo;t stop! we&rsquo;re information systems that grow by making mistakes. roll more d20s!!</p>
<p>predict, act, observe, correct, predict, act, observe, correct. at every level of our being. we don&rsquo;t stop, until we perish</p>
