the less you consciously care about sex, the stronger your unconscious libido becomes.

too many men are obsessed with sex and become goon zombies with a dysfunctional internal world model.
caring about sex is a psy-op, you should literally only have sex to procreate, anything else is degeneracy - especially masturbation.

    <h3 id="sex-obsession">Sex Obsession</h3>
<p>the less you consciously care about sex, the stronger your unconscious libido becomes.</p>
<p>few understand this</p>
<p>too many men are obsessed with sex and become goon zombies with a dysfunctional internal world model.</p>
<p>caring about sex is a psy-op, you should literally only have sex to procreate, anything else is degeneracy - <strong>especially masturbation.</strong></p>
<h3 id="will-power-and-impulse-control">Will Power and Impulse Control</h3>
<p>sexual impulse control has a <strong>direct</strong> correlation to will power.</p>
<p>Libido is typically the most powerful human impulse &amp; intrinsically tied to the life force of a person, thus the control of your sexual desires can be considered a test of will.</p>
<p>Undergoing a period of celibacy (no self-pleasure nor pleasure via others) was also considered an important rite in many ancient spiritual traditions, as it represents an overcoming of animalistic desires &amp; urges in the pursuit of a higher enlightened state of being.</p>
<p>Thus, the purpose of sex for a higher enlightened being that overcomes sexual urges, returns to the natural purity of being a reproductive mechanism.</p>
<p>This is not to say that &lsquo;you can never have sex unless you are conceiving children&rsquo;, but I think it&rsquo;s important for everyone to try to go through periods of celibacy to ground themselves.</p>
<p>As once you&rsquo;ve been celibate for a while, your brain starts to recalibrate neural pathways, and with time you will probably be disgusted by things you had previously thought were relatively harmless such as masturbation.</p>
<p>Men need to let go of their obsession with women. Even men who claim to hate women are plagued, they can’t stop thinking about them. Men with wives too! Once men do, they’ll reclaim their life force instead of putting their energy into a parasitic egregore.</p>
<p>He must isolate to find his power and then re-emerge in the world.</p>
<p><em>Note this is not the same for an asexual or incel type of person, where rejection / denial of sex out of insecurity or fear of rejection is rather a vice than a virtue, due to the nature of the intention behind the celibacy.</em></p>
<h3 id="the-strongest-nootropic">The strongest nootropic</h3>
<p>celibacy is the strongest nootropic</p>
<p>most men&rsquo;s libido is highjacked by their dopaminic fiendish tendencies, like drug addicts seeking a constant fix their dopey minds haven&rsquo;t realized the power available if they just got over their sexual insecurities &amp; reclaimed their libido.</p>
