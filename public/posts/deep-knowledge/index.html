    <p>my problem with programming languages that have features is that I will inevitably need to interact with them to fix that one bug that is deep in the stack. so what i want is for it to to look as much like go as possible</p>
<p>like really what i need is to be able to run an interpreter in my head while i read code. i can read code really quickly. but as soon as you have some special doohickey that does things non explicitly i will have to add to my mind&rsquo;s corpus and frankly i am short on time</p>
<p>this is why i&rsquo;m a big fan of just doing it in C and dodging everything. like, apple&rsquo;s libraries are <em>closed source</em>. You&rsquo;re telling me I can&rsquo;t actually read the code that I&rsquo;m depending on? How can I know what it does&hellip;?!?</p>
<p>I realize that I&rsquo;m much different from the average programmer with different needs &amp; wants. What I want is to not ever be stopped. Which means total control over what&rsquo;s happening, and building that very skill. People get confused as to why kaparthy is doing llms in C. This is why</p>
<p>this is actually me saying you shouldn&rsquo;t do it in C, and instead, you should use the tools at your disposal for speedrunning programming languages. if you understand computers well enough you don&rsquo;t have to be limited by it</p>
