    <h1>Learning Karpathy</h1>

    

    <p><strong>There are a lot of videos on YouTube/TikTok etc. that give the appearance of education, but if you look closely they are really just entertainment.</strong> This is very convenient for everyone involved : the people watching enjoy thinking they are learning (but actually they are just having fun).</p>
<p><strong>Learning is not supposed to be fun. The primary feeling should be that of effort.</strong> It should look a lot less like that &ldquo;10 minute full body&rdquo; workout from your local digital media creator and a lot more like a serious session at the gym. <strong>You want the mental equivalent of sweating.</strong></p>
<p>I find it helpful to <strong>explicitly declare your intent up front as a sharp, binary variable in your mind. If you are consuming content: are you trying to be entertained or are you trying to learn?</strong> And if you are creating content: are you trying to entertain or are you trying to teach? You&rsquo;ll go down a different path in each case. <strong>Attempts to seek the stuff in between actually clamp to zero.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So for those who actually want to learn.</strong> Unless you are trying to learn something narrow and specific, close those tabs with quick blog posts. <strong>Close those tabs of &ldquo;Learn XYZ in 10 minutes&rdquo;.</strong> Consider the opportunity cost of snacking and <strong>seek the meal - the textbooks, docs, papers, manuals, longform. Allocate a 4 hour window. Don&rsquo;t just read, take notes, re-read, re-phrase, process, manipulate, learn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How to become an expert at a thing:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Iteratively take on concrete projects and accomplish them depth wise, learning &ldquo;on demand&rdquo;</strong> (ie don&rsquo;t learn bottom up breadth wise).</li>
<li><strong>Teach/summarize</strong> everything you learn in your own words.</li>
<li><strong>Only compare yourself to younger you, never to others.</strong></li>
</ol>
