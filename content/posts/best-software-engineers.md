The best software engineers come from one or more of these areas (in no order; not limited to):

- game dev (gfx, physics, etc.)
- OS/kernel dev
- security (not cert land, real hacking, usually modding)

They're super creative, fast, and they make tons of intricate considerations about what they're building.
