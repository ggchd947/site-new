### The virgin Internal voice
- Thinking speed is limited to his internal speech
- Squeaky internal voice
- Has to imagine a voice talking in his head when he reads
- Accidentally thinks out loud
- Spews whatever comes first in an argument
- Understand abstract concepts only if he has the words for them
- Cannot comprehend that people can think without an inner voice
- Anyone with a mind-reading device can tell what he is thinking
- Would bring nothing of value to a telepathic hive mind

### The Chad Cerebration
- Can think as fast as his brain allows him to
- Complex and indescribable thought patterns
- Lightning-fast reading, understand sentences as soon as he sees them
- Silent and mysterious, always appear deep in thought
- Choose his words carefully as to express his complex thoughts accurately
- Can understand abstract concepts that are beyond human speech
- Can use an inner voice but doesn't, because he knows it's inefficient
- Immune to mind-reading
- Telepathic hive mind superstar
