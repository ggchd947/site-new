![most valuable Google engineer](/img/dump/google-chad.jpg)
This man is a true genius and the most valuable Google engineer. He's like a god at Google and not even the CEO would go against him. He literally made Google what it is today and wrote/worked-on all of their most important software stacks. He's worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

Now, notice something interesting:

He doesn't  have two, three or four monitors and he doesn't have some gigantic TV screen that kills your focus and distracts him from everything important.

He doesn't have some bullshit meme mech keyboard with some special switches that were forged by elves in Japan from katana-grade steel and lights that emit perfect sRGB colors.

He doesn't have a mouse with refresh rate so high that it breaks spacetime continuum every time you slide it across your desk.

He doesn't have a $300 pair of audiophile grade headphones.

He doesn't have some super-expensive chair with all kinds of knobs and adjustments that can even massage your prostate.

He doesn't have some tricked out text editor with million different features and colors.

He doesn't run some super-autistic Linux distro like Arch that demands you babysit it all the time.

He doesn't have some DE with customized CSS UI that you usually see in tons of threads on reddit.

He didn't even change the default theme, colors or the default background.

He can afford all that shit, yet he doesn't waste his time on it. Instead, he writes 100x more lines of code than you and it 1,000,000x more accomplished than you'll ever be. And he's infinitely smarter than you'll ever be.

So quit falling for fucking memes and quit craving all the latest bullshit that gets posted online in these cancerous consumerist social media platforms that just make you feel inadequate. **Just learn your craft and get better.** What matters is what's in your head and how you express yourself and not what you have on your desk.
