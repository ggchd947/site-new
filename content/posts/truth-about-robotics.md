### Learn Mechanical/Robot Design & Manufacturing
The reason I'm spending every spare hour I have in mechanical design and robot design / manufacturing is because it's obvious to me that the software for useful robots at home has been solved

I don't think that a robot that goes around your home and picks up things left on the floor and leaves it in a container is hard at all to build and it would be incredibly useful. Or a robot that patrols my lawn and physically mangles baby weeds

It's just new skills to pick up. Unfortunately hardware folks use limiting proprietary software as they have no software skills and don't know any better, but openscad (and libfive if I need to) just works and I can start pumping out designs if I keep on hacking

The main thing is that I'm actually building stuff in general. I just gotta keep my 3d printer PLA and the openscad scripts flowing


### The redpill on Robotics
don't let them fool you, the software has already been solved

pay attention, focus on the thing that actually matters

**designing** robots to be **cheap**, and **manufacturing** them at **scale**

going from arbitrary robot prototype to control software has been solved.

I'm literally screaming this, in your face. Do you understand what that means?

**The only differential now is the ability to prototype and build robots, fast**

I'm not talking about making money. I'm talking about if you want to be a human who has a will to power. If you are looking to maximize your ability to manipulate the world around you, learn how to build robots independently without dependencies

load up [thang010146](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCli_RJkGWfZvw4IlDLHNCQg/videos) and start learning. This is not a recommendation, this is a warning

you could literally build a useful robot out of cardboard. do you understand what I'm saying???

there is literally **ZERO REASON** robots should cost more than 40 dollars

make it out of **DOMINOS PIZZA BOXES**
