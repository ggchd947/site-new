It's funny to see people cope about china destroying them competitively by using "muh ip". I have seen your IP. It's not worth the paper it's written on. Blog posts by grad students have more value. There is no reason to even copy American IP because it isn't worth crap.

Everyone who claims this has never actually produced any informational know how i their lives anyways.

The only thing that matters is production and utility. The industrialists before us understood this. Intellectual property is a misnomer.

It's not intellectual property. There is no such thing. It's intellectual secrecy for your own benefit. Don't complain when you get scooped by the hard working Chinese. If you are smarter than them, why is there a bambu labs printer in every techies house in America?

If you think you are smarter than the Chinese, why have they completely cornered the 3D printer market and not you?

What's the value of your 'intellectual property' if you don't produce product?

Where can I buy your robot? Oh I can't? Right. Because it's fake. And now you want to rent seek on actuators that a 16 year old Vietnamese mech kid could figure out in a day.

**You suck.**
