AML/KYC is so broken.

The banking system launders $5 trillion a year[^1], that's 5% of GDP, criminals have a 99% success rate laundering money through the banks.

In exchange for this colossal failure of a policy the entire world is required to give up all economic privacy while seeding vast honeypots of personal data to insecure third-parties which virtually guarantees their future identity theft.

Now you're required to send your drivers license to more than 20 different organizations for AML/KYC - I'm sure it's available for sale in a dozen different databases along with every adult you know.

How about the liveness checks? Not only can AI know this over like a marshmellow in a hurricane, now you're forced to give even more of your biometric data to a third-party that once again can be purchased by criminals or the government.

Maybe there's no real benefit in AML/KYC, they know it's a failed policy but they don't care.

Maybe surveillance is the point.
