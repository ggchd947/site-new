"Be sure to **read daily**, even one page, from the discourses of Abba Isaac the Syrian. After the Gospel he will be your guide. **And when you have finished the whole book, start all over again.**"

"What other spiritual book should I read, Elder?"

"**Abba Isaac**"

"Okay, you told me about Abba Isaac. Do you have another book to recommend to me?"

"**Abba Isaac. I am never satiated with the blessed one.**"
