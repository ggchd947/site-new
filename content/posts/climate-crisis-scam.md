### Introduction
The definition of **The Climate Change** according to Google is: **Human activities causing world temperatures to rise, with more intense heatwaves and rising sea-levels among the consequences.** In elementary and middle school, we were told that we need to do our part in stopping climate change. Things like turn off lights you're not using, don't leave the sink running and RRR! (Reuse, Reduce, Recycle). But over the years, they started telling us that energy sources like oil, natural gas and even **NUCLEAR ENERGY** were non-renewable sources of energy, and we should do everything we can to avoid using them. Of course, that's impractical because these non-renewable source of energy are very vital for everyday life (except for nuclear energy, for now...).

### The Problem
Today, climate change is no longer called climate change. To make this "problem" seem worse than it is, they changed the name from *climate change* to *climate crisis*. This was done because ***"Climate change is no longer considered to accurately reflect the seriousness of the overall situation"***

### The Current Climate Crisis Narrative
This tweet by 24yo climate activist Clover Hogan demonstrates perfectly what the majority of "climate activists" or people "concerned" about climate change believe:

The purpose of the Climate Crisis Narrative is to justify authoritarian control over agriculture, transportation, industry, and speech.

The fact that these measures won't actually solve the threat of global warming is unimportant.

They don't want a solution. They want power.

Translation: "our goal is not to actually solve climate change but rather to install global communism where we are in power"
