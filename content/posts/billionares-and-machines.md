I was listening to a [interview with George Hotz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpUyL3IuULo) when I heard an amazing quote that answered the question about people being uncomfortable about AI

"People complaining about billionaires wasting money going to space are going to be ***shocked*** when they find out how much money governments waste. People who are concerned about machines being black boxes are going to be ***shocked*** when they find out about humans. Maybe I ask those people whether old people telling people what to think really had their best interests in mind or not."
