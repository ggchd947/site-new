**There are a lot of videos on YouTube/TikTok etc. that give the appearance of education, but if you look closely they are really just entertainment.** This is very convenient for everyone involved : the people watching enjoy thinking they are learning (but actually they are just having fun).

**Learning is not supposed to be fun. The primary feeling should be that of effort.** It should look a lot less like that "10 minute full body" workout from your local digital media creator and a lot more like a serious session at the gym. **You want the mental equivalent of sweating.**

I find it helpful to **explicitly declare your intent up front as a sharp, binary variable in your mind. If you are consuming content: are you trying to be entertained or are you trying to learn?** And if you are creating content: are you trying to entertain or are you trying to teach? You'll go down a different path in each case. **Attempts to seek the stuff in between actually clamp to zero.**

**So for those who actually want to learn.** Unless you are trying to learn something narrow and specific, close those tabs with quick blog posts. **Close those tabs of "Learn XYZ in 10 minutes".** Consider the opportunity cost of snacking and **seek the meal - the textbooks, docs, papers, manuals, longform. Allocate a 4 hour window. Don't just read, take notes, re-read, re-phrase, process, manipulate, learn.**

**How to become an expert at a thing:**
1. **Iteratively take on concrete projects and accomplish them depth wise, learning "on demand"** (ie don't learn bottom up breadth wise).
2. **Teach/summarize** everything you learn in your own words.
3. **Only compare yourself to younger you, never to others.**
