palmer luckey sold oculus at 22 for 2 billion dollars off a kickstarter and you're raising?

why raise? just get a job at an AI lab and make 2 million dollars

for 4 years lmao. you can do what you want afterwards

and honestly, if you aren't good enough to get a job at an AI lab that pays that much, then you aren't good enough to build a b$ company
