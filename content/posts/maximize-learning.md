If you want to maximize learning, you need to maximize the amount of mistakes you make. aim for like a 30/70 split of error to success. then, maximize by doing more things more often in smaller steps. focus on the count of total errors. don't stop. keep on doing things

we work pretty much exactly like neural network models of the world. focus on making errors, grounded by the truth you've built so far. add resolution. add resolution. don't stop! we're information systems that grow by making mistakes. roll more d20s!!

predict, act, observe, correct, predict, act, observe, correct. at every level of our being. we don't stop, until we perish
