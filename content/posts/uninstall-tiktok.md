National cybersecurity is one of the most important topics of our time.

Quick recap of the most successful fifth column attack ever, TikTok:

- Chinese government develops a world class algorithm to hack people's dopamine centers
- Leverages addiction machine to subvert democracy and stifle free speech by algorithmic selection
- Uses Algo to push divisive and antigrowth narratives in geopolitical rivals, foment dissent, stir revolt, corrupt moral fabric
- Uses massive market penetration to collect information on every individual possible and segment entire American demographic
- Against backdrop of decades long-running corporate espionage stealing US IP - 2/3rds of companies reporting attempts of theft by China
- The irony is they defend this strategy by appeals to the principles of free speech and liberty they so viciously deny their own citizens.
- TikTok is simply the digital manifestation of the Comintern - a sprawling tentacled organization to subvert democracy and capitalism abroad and bring the world under socialist control

Do your country a favor and uninstall it immediately.
