### @yacineMTB
@yacineMTB real opinion about ADHD

the disease is made up. We are distributional humans and boxing in doesn't work. Just learn to cope with your weakness and play to your strengths. Giving your state a name and identifying with it is often just coping with your lack of agency to help.

I am not saying that you can't have problems that are so bad that you can barely live. Actually, this is me! I am so forgetful that it affects my life. But I just use my creativity to figure out ways to make systems that correct for it.

Since highschool (10th) grade and through university I would mostly skip every single class that I couldn't pay attention to. Why **should** I pay attention? Maybe your boring dumb ass class is the problem, not me

I didn't skip the good classes that interested me, that captured me

"oh you must have gotten bad grades"

I didn't because I'm not a bitch

I figured out how to work around it. In hs gamed exams by grinding through past exams. I'd seriously skip every class, and grind for a month and get an A.

Why **should** I pay attention, if I can do that?

You want me to sit through a dumb ass bird course elective in university? No, I'll just read it on Wikipedia the night before and bullshit the essays and get a C. Your made up bullshit class is bullshit. You know it, everyone knows it.

I'll sit through my algorithms, combinatorics, and number theory classes. The professors aren't full of shit. They genuinely, genuinely care. I'll focus

I took a tech writing class, I thought it would be easy. It wasn't. The professor challenged me. So I attended and focused.

I struggle with internet addiction and not getting distracted. So I'm doing something about it

My twitter bar:

I use an adblocker to remove all notifications alert. My messages. No notification link. Even the tab on the browser doesn't have it

I have trouble when I tab to chatgpt, and it takes too long. I get distracted and check emails, hnews, x dot come, messenger, signal. So I wrote an extension that uses a faster LLM right in my text editor. No tabbing necessary

"I can't get good grades, I have ADHD"

no dumbass, you just don't want to get good grades. Maybe there's a reason you don't want to get good grades. Pay attention to what you want, not what you're told you should want

You have a lot more control over your environment, your own mental state included, than you think. Do something about it!
