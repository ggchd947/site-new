### Great idea from @mallocmyheart
If Nix had a simple GUI to install apps by adding them to the config then it might actually be the best Linux distro for non-technical people. My thinking is that non-technical users wouldn't have to deal with nixlang if they were given a well rounded default config. Tech support would be easy since the user would only have to share a single file in order for support to replicate and fix most problems.
