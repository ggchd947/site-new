## What is Delta 4 Theory?
In short, [Delta 4 theory](https://www.seedtoscale.com/blog/kunal-shahs-delta-4-theory-of-successful-startups) is a theory about how much your product improves the customer experience over what the alternative provides, whether it be another product or an old way of doing things.

## The Problem
{{< x user="tsarnick" id=1835113831435321799 >}}
If $100B is the cost to train the future frontier models, **you are a unicorn if you can help save 0.1% of the cost.**

## The Solution
A **distributed**, **peer-to-peer (P2P) system** for **GPU-based AI model training and inference.**

[There are millions of high-end gaming GPUs](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/) under utilized every second, I would subscribe to a service that uses mine when I'm not and pay me.

Load the inference model based on demand, monitor CUDA, perform inference when not being used. API gateway to deliver results. Serve standard models to begin with. This is actually not that difficult to build.

If we incentivize with pay per use, there will be more seeders than leechers.

**Pay in USD, direct deposit, twice a month.**

**Have clear on boarding to buy/sell GPU compute, THIS SHOULD BE FRONT AND CENTER**

**BE NETWORKED LIKE BITTORRENT**

**Clients not have to worry about the particular hardware they're renting**

**Client software in WINDOWS/LINUX**

**POTENTIALLY USE NVIDIA AND M1/2/3 TOGETHER IN THE NETWORK????!!!**

**Set your own deal for jobs or the market can set it for you automatically**

**Use whatever GPUs make sense (NVIDIA/AMD should work the same)**

**Less uptime is okay, delay or resubmit job**

**For training more latency is fine**

*NOTE: whatever you make work for training you get for free for inference.*
*NOTE: https://youtu.be/Gm0t-kAsHuY?t=16407 - beluga.ai charge $0.50 an hour*

do these and I'll win.

## The Competition
competition is for losers /s

There's already HUGE interest in this:
![interest](/img/dump/customer_int.png)

### Nous Research
{{< x user="NousResearch" id=1828121648383566270 >}}

### bittensor
- Has a currency called [$TAO](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bittensor) which pays "seeders" with $3.4B market cap
- Doesn't look ready for commercial scaling or consumer signups yet

### tinygrad/tinycorp
- George Hotz has made a plan [very similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJbUaciFdV8)
- His written plan [on GitHub](https://github.com/tinygrad/toonygrad/blob/master/PLAN.md)
- Clip here explaining how this isn't a illegal business; [no crypto.](https://youtu.be/LJbUaciFdV8?t=3384)

### Akash Console
- Definitely close so far, unsure if optimized for consumer hardware. Looks like people with idle on-prem datacenter hardware
- Also pays users in some random no-name crypto token. But then there's [$TAO](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bittensor). **Pay in USD, direct deposit, twice a month.**

### The Render Network
- Can I sell my GPU hours? (No)
- Where's the link?
- Where's the client software to download?
- Where's the docs?
- No **clear on boarding to buy/sell GPU compute**
- Promotes their token more than the actual product

### vast.ai
- Looks way closer than anything else so far
- **However, people buying GPU compute on vast.ai have to worry about the details of the particuluar hardware they're renting**
- **It's not networked**

### exolabs.net
- exo's mission is to democratize access to AI.
- Building open infrastructure to train frontier models
- Keep an eye on them. They're doing cool things.

## beluga.ai

**"We orchestrate idle GPUs. Our mission is to democratize AI computing power."**

Buy beluga.ai and beluga.com

Maybe make website look similar to this? - https://www.inference.net/

[Skills like programming massively parallel processors](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0323912311) is a must. Contribute to [tinygrad](https://tinygrad.org/) to have some experience with A.I frameworks. Go through [ai.html](https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/ai.html) and [fromthetensor](https://github.com/jla524/fromthetensor).

1. Beluga whales are known for their intelligence and social behavior, which aligns well with the concept of distributed, collaborative computing.
2. Belugas are also known for their distinctive vocalizations and "echolocation", which can be seen as a metaphor for the communication and coordination in your distributed network.
3. The ".ai" domain clearly indicates the company's focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning.
4. Short, simple names are often more memorable and easier to brand.
5. Animal names in tech can be quite successful (think Twitter/X's bird, Mozilla's firefox, or GitHub's octocat).

This name could work well for the distributed GPU computing concept, as it suggests a network of intelligent entities working together - much like a pod of beluga whales. It's approachable yet techy, which could help in attracting both individual GPU owners and potential enterprise clients.
