I'm interested in how systems work.

I started with man-made systems, like how does software work and how can I reverse engineer it and understand how it operates even if I don't have the source code.

Then I got into hardware and how to reverse engineer that.

**I'm trying to go further and further down the stack** and now I'm getting into physics level reverse engineering which is more understanding nature than it is man-made systems.

### High Level RE Overview
bold means i'm currently on that stage

**software** -> hardware -> physics/quantum mechanics
