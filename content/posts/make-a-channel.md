Bro look at 3blue1brown or w/e his name is vids. It's very OMG MATH soooo beutifuuul kind of cringe but take from it important things like a visual showcase. Make your vids visual and speak to the viewer but in less cringe and you will do fine. I make these vids all the time btw just I don't post them, many of them do well one of them paid my rent in NY for 3 months and is still growing. It takes a long time to make a channel.

All you guys should be making channels, vids, whatever it's how you learn because then you have dive deep into the material. All the existing vids are pure trash.

Like nobody has a good big-O video, none of them understand it.

Nobody has a good amortized video either

Nobody has a language based Big-O video, it's important for parallel ... that means not based on RAM model or w/e other bullshit model. Let's be honest writes are not going to be O(1) soon because they will be in some cloud.
