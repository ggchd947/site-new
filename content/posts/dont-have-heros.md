sometimes hero worship can go a little too far - when you raise someone to the level of godhood, are you really just making up an excuse for yourself? for why you haven't done it yourself?

"i just wasn't lucky enough to be gifted like them"

the truth is: there is actually nothing different about John Carmack, Palmer Luckey, Elon Musk, Adrej Kaparthy and other great men of note, when comparing them to yourself. They don't have anything you don't have! Trust me!

you can do what they have done. you really can

you have something they didn't! their example

there really isn't anything different about your heroes & yourself. you'd know this if you paid attention. or if you just asked them directly

that's why i tend to follow the belief "don't have heros, be a hero"

try to be as good or better than those who inspire you
