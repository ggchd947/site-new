the gap between the very rich & everyone else is actually shrinking drastically over time due to hyper capitalism + tech.

- you drink the same coke as a billionaire.

- you use the same iphone as a billionaire on the same network.

- you use the exact same tools as a billionaire, e.g. chatgpt --- there is no special ultra rich person versions of software or apps.

- you read the same garbage online as a billionaire.

- you post in the same fashion as a billionaire on the same networks.

- a billionaire poops on the same type of toilet as you do.

- you’re afforded ~roughly the same healthcare as a billionaire (assuming you have insurance) with marginal differences.

- you can roughly go travel to any place just like a billionaire can (private vs not).

- you can eat & drink the same foods as a billionaire (e.g. go to a michelin star spot etc).

- you can wear the same clothing & fashion accessories (or even get knockoff lookalikes for cheap).

- you and the billionaire counterpart face the same problems with love & relationships, in fact yours might be easier.

- being a billionaire likely comes with its own set of challenges that you don’t ever have to think or worry about.

there are very few things you don’t truly have access to as capitalism & sheer force of technology slowly make virtually anything into a commodity.

we truly live in a profoundly abundant & accessible world & it’s unclear if humans have the capacity to deal with abundance of this magnitude.

the kings / elites of past & everyone else had a much wider gap in terms of access & lifestyle… and perhaps were happier that way.
