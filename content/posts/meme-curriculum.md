### Motivation
![YOU CAN DO ANYTHING AFTER INTRO](/img/dump/INTRO_YOU_CAN_DO_ANYTHING.png)
YOU ONLY NEED A **SINGLE INTRO COURSE** and you **CAN DO ANYTHING**. Everything else is a specialty curriculum.

It literally is just **persistence** and **refusing to give up** and you **succeed.**

7. Final step, bug bounty programs on [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/) and [Remedy](https://r.xyz/bug-bounty/programs)

### A Strategy For Doing Contests
Just do the contest until you reach the point where it's not worth your time.

You'll find most of your submissions on the first 2 days if it's a 7 day contest.

Looking at the rewards, it's not worth spending 5 more days looking for 1 more bug.

So you jump to another contest running in parallel and keep doing the same thing for all the contests running in parallel for as long as you can.

You will not get full coverage with this approach but it's no big deal.

Keep doing this for a long enough period of time and **you'll become one of the best with this strategy.**

### After finishing the above!!1!

~Take [Security](https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/theabsolutestateofsoftware.html) and [AI](https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/ai.html) at the same time.~
