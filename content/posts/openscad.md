### Tutorials
Cracked chinese source, math heavy - https://openhome.cc/eGossip/OpenSCAD/index.html

John's Basement is quick & dirty, do first - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3by7evD3F51u-17hoepe7IduGkfp2Fu6

mathcodeprint is REALLY GOOD - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkRx3bM9e3yA7YhauhvCiV9v2a4RBp0Xa

### Books
***NOTE: I DON'T KNOW IF THESE BOOKS ARE WORTH IT***

[Make: Geometry](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Geometry-coding-printing-building/dp/1680456717/) - Do this book first, hopefully learn Geometry properly this time :/

[Make: Trigonometry](https://www.amazon.com/MAKE-Trigonometry-triangles-analytic-geometry/dp/1680457985) - After Make: Geometry. Moving forward the books focus on the geometry rather than the algebra.

[Make: Calculus](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Calculus-models-visualize-explore/dp/168045739X/) - Builds geometric intuition and not algebra, retains very little algebra.


### Libraries
BOSL (v1), A library of tools, shapes, and helpers making OpenSCAD easier to use - https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL

dotSCAD, reduce the burden of mathematics when playing OpenSCAD - https://github.com/JustinSDK/dotSCAD

### Design Challenges
Find designs in the wild and try to recreate them in openscad. Builds technical skill and if it worked for Da Vinci, it works for me.

#### TODO
- [Soma Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma_cube)
- [507 Mechanical Movements](https://507movements.com/)
