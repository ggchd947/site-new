tech debt is a meme because things that add tech debt actually

take more time to write than the thing that doesn't add tech debt

99% of the time "tech debt" is just a cope excuse. "couldn't ship fast because of muh muh muh tech debit". Attach a debugger lmao it's not that hard. Just rewrite the parts that you don't understand. Same phenomena as complaints about "bad code".

No such thing as bad code dawg
