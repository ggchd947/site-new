An underappreciated aspect of productivity: **momentum.**

The more stuff you do the easier it becomes to do stuff (literally anything). And inversely.

The idea here is that doing something difficult/high-effort has a high mental **activation energy** (separate from the energy needed to actually doing it).

If you're only sparsely active, you have to pay this price every time, which is inefficient, painful, and actually disincentivizes you from doing things -- leading to **procrastination.**

If you're always active, you never have to pay this price, making it dramatically easier and less mentally draining to do pretty much anything.
