@yacineMTB has talked about turning gaussian splats into CAD models but there's another (not mutually exclusive) way to make CAD better.

Why don't we have a Quest 3 ~~or AVP (apple lockdown is retarded)~~ app that lets you talk through creating a CAD model?

"Let's start with a 40 by 80 by 20mm rectangular prism. Punch an M5 clearance hole through this side right here, 10mm from the edge and centered. Now give me a flange along this edge, 3mm thick and radius the top corners 5 mm" and so on.

That would be worth millions and should totally be doable with current tech.

- be interactive
- run locally with whisper/llama.cpp
- It should also suggest best practices as you go.

"Wouldn't you like an internal fillet in that location?"

"According to my calculations, that lug will fail at 10kN, would you like me to properly size it?"
