Linux was my passionate project, set to replace Mac OS and Windows. But Linux fanboys have ruined it's image. Most of them take pride in doing simple things in an over complicated manner and wonder why people won't switch. Even basic tasks like loading kernels or installing something is told in such a gatekeeping manner that scares new users into adapting it. The worse part is, they think they are intelligent because of few lines of codes. But reality couldn't be farther from the truth. Most of them fail at elementary coding and copy it from somewhere else. They are most stupid of them all.
