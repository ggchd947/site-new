Start making decisions at work.

Start taking responsibility.

What's the worst that could happen? They fire you?

The worst thing that could happen is that you get fired, you'll be fine. You can move back to your parent's place in a first world country. The only reason you wouldn't be fine is because you're a coward.

### You can just do things
Competence without assertiveness gets punished not rewarded at work.

If you're going to display any effectiveness start getting ready to start saying "no" regularly.

### Burnout Solution
Just don't work more than 8 hours.

That's the secret sauce.

Make decisions, have ownership, move the things around that need to be moved to make things happen.

Clock out at 5 religiously.
