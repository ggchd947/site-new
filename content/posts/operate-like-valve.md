It can really be like this.

Companies can actually operate like this.

It can be like this. This is actually the default. Get rid of the politics incentive.

Your company is your incentive. Just do what gabe newell does
![working without a boss](/img/dump/no_boss.jpg)

Instead of rewarding head count under person (even though you say you aren't, everyone knows you are)

reward things done per unit of time per dollar spent. **Reward efficiency**, not bloatedness.

If you are the leader of a company, like, the leader, stop falling for people's bullshit. Trust your gut and act on it. Get rid of people who are not letting engineers engineer and sales people sell.

The fact that you're not taking advantage of opportunity X isn't a headcount problem. It's a creativity problem. If you don't let people hire they will solve that problem creatively. It's easier to hire bodies, yes. But it's just an engineering problem.

If you're a ceo, don't give people root access to your company. You need ot vet every single hire personally.

Eugenio Pace / Matias Woloski of auth0 would meet every single new hire before series B. Every single one. If it imposes a limiter on your org growth, guess what: that's a good thing.
