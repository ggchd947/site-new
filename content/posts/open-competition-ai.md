Open competition is such an insane force. We have to build AGI because China is building it too. Full stop, we have to build it as soon as possible, and no EA/AI safety/whatever arguments against that goal matter.

The corollary is that we can't regulate this and an open market for models i crucial. We're facing off with an evil empire, we need all hands on deck, and VCs to fund every project. We have that right now and I hope it doesn't go away.

Any other ways to solve this problem will crush morale and thus are unacceptable.
