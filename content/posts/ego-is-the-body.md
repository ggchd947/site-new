the ego is the body.

you will have an ego as long as you live and this is a good thing as your ego exists to protect you.

when people talk about ego death they either mean a state of consciousness where you bypass your body or they mean shedding a maladaptive form of the ego.

many have a misconception & believe enlightenment entails a form of ego death where the person remains completely detached from the material self, but this is a fallacy

you exist through your physical body

you are the glove & the hand

you are the vessel & the incarnate

---

so you should love your self, truly.

strive to be better than everyone else

but do it by providing more value than anyone else

strive to perfect your physical form

because it will also effect your mental form
