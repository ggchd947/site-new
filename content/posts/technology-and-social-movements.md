### Prologue
There are people who are wrong once in a while.

There are people who are wrong as often as they are right.

And then there is a small minority of nitwits so clueless that they would drink bleach if enough of the pet journalists of the political class told them it would avert the apocalypse.

### Adult talk time
The world will never make any scrap of sense to you until you understand one basic principle:

There is no such thing as social justice[^1], or social progress[^2].
There is only technological justice, and technological progress.

Doesn't make sense?

I'll explain.

Imagine, for a moment, the medieval era. Nations are ruled by kings, who command nobles, who command knights.

> Medieval knight in armor

The armored knight, charging on the back of his armored warhorse with leveled war lance, is the basic unit of warfare.

And he costs a lot. All that armor must be hand-made and custom-fitted by skilled craftsman at a high price. The horse? Even more expensive. And then it must be trained. And the knight himself must train in arms constantly, and others must work to support him.

Knights are expensive, which means the nation can only support a few of them, relatively speaking. Which means that a king must only command the loyalty of a solid majority of this very small minority to control the kingdom.

Peasants don't have armor, warhorses, or lances, so their opinions don't matter. King doesn't have to keep them happy.

So, as an obvious consequence, power concentrated in the hands of the few. Monarchy, autocracy. Consequence of technology.

It wasn't black powder that changed the equation, not precisely. Musketeers and cannon co-existed for hundreds of years with armored knights and pikemen, and there was plenty of expensive armor that could turn a musket ball.

No, what changed was rifling. A spin-stabilized rifle bullet will make Swiss cheese of any suit of full armor that a man can wear and still walk.

Now, suddenly, the basic unit of violent force isn't the expensive armored knight, it's the peasant farmer with a modestly-priced tube.

What we call "democracy", really meaning the wider distribution of political influence becomes inevitable. It takes two revolutions and a whole lot of arguing, but the outcome is a foregone conclusion. Had the American and French revolutions failed, the next ones would have succeeded. Tech determines outcomes.

### Social movements aren't necessary
What the principle behind this example means is that all those social movements, all that marching around, all that university stuff they think is so important... it might be just an afterthought.

A renegotiation to reflect changing market conditions.

That would mean that [Clover Hogan](https://ggchd.xyz/posts/climate-crisis-scam/) doesn't matter. Only nuclear plants matter. Naturally, the Clover Hogans of the world are opposed to this idea, because it doesn't give them anything to do, or anything to feel virtuous and important over.

Heck, it doesn't even give them anyone to fight, because your standard monster-truck enthusiast is gonna have no objections whatsoever to building more reacts. He's even going to buy an electric monster truck, once batteries get somewhat better, people stop shouting in his ear, and he has some time to really contemplate what the phrase "full torque from zero RPM" actually means.

And oil company execs aren't on social media for Clover to yell at.

Meaningful social progress, that is, progress during the age of the Internet, is produced by engineers, not community organizers.

This is why all the "green tech" political programs in the world have produced nothing but corruption, graft, arguments, and stupid wind farms that don't work.

And this is why one software-company mogul with money to burn outdid them all by producing an electric car you're not embarrassed to be seen driving.

The "green revolution" isn't waiting on a bunch of idiot twenty-somethings waving signs, blocking freeways, [throwing paint on art treasures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUhRAiZS70E), [and having toddleresque tantrums in from the of the UN.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9KxE4Kv9A8)

### Innovation Wins
It's waiting on cheaper, simpler reactors, on better batteries, on high-temp superconductors, on photoelectric cells that don't totally suck, on fusion containment that works outside the lab.

Don't care about carbon emissions? Don't think humans are powerful enough to significantly warm the planet? Notice the polar ice is still there and sea levels haven't risen?

Fine.

Do it for cheap power and the second industrial revolution. Because if you thought the first one gave us cool stuff, if you like the fact that "poor" people now have cars and heated homes and clean clothes to wear and plenty to eat, then wait until you see what the next one has in store for you.

Because the thing that lifts people out of poverty, the thing that brings about liberty and justice for all, the thing that fixes the world and makes things better in every way...

is the thing that lifted us out of the much in the first place.

**Innovation.**

Now go make something.
