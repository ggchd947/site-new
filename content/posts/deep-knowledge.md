my problem with programming languages that have features is that I will inevitably need to interact with them to fix that one bug that is deep in the stack. so what i want is for it to to look as much like go as possible

like really what i need is to be able to run an interpreter in my head while i read code. i can read code really quickly. but as soon as you have some special doohickey that does things non explicitly i will have to add to my mind's corpus and frankly i am short on time

this is why i'm a big fan of just doing it in C and dodging everything. like, apple's libraries are *closed source*. You're telling me I can't actually read the code that I'm depending on? How can I know what it does...?!?

I realize that I'm much different from the average programmer with different needs & wants. What I want is to not ever be stopped. Which means total control over what's happening, and building that very skill. People get confused as to why kaparthy is doing llms in C. This is why

this is actually me saying you shouldn't do it in C, and instead, you should use the tools at your disposal for speedrunning programming languages. if you understand computers well enough you don't have to be limited by it
