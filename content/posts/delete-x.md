You know what? X is like the Instagram of "cracked" results.

### Instagramification of my feed
- Neovim screenshots with dingboard memes of implementing everything from scratch.
- humble brags of "oh 12 hrs of straight coding on a weekend"
- wanderlust replaced by "cracked"
- LC grinding replaced by "implement your own Redis"

Seeing cracked results on your TL is inspiring but can also be demoralizing like Instagram.

I'm done with X, I knew social media was bad but the fact it took me this long is interesting to say the least.
