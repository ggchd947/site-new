"The more you know, the less you diversify." -- [@naval](https://x.com/naval)

### Proof

The more you know, the more you can trust your own judgment.

The more you can trust your judgment, the less you need to hedge against being wrong.

The less you hedge, the more risk you can afford to take.

The more risk you take, the more rewards you can achieve.

Thus, the more you know, the less you diversify.
