It's now possible for X to beat NYT and CNN at their own game. Just use AI to render the X feed as a **better newspaper** and a **better TV station,** and then distribute it wherever NYT and CNN are found.

Here's how.

## Phase I
**Start with an AI paper.** The core idea is to use AI to generate a newspaper-quality site from the raw X feed (scrape X). If you look at X Explore, we're already almost there! Then use AI to generate a proper newspaper from the feed, auto-update every hour, with permalinks and author bios and everything. Much of what NYT does anyway is reprinting X posts without attribution --- **so just use AI to cut out the middle.** Throw in high quality crosswords and cooking to compete with every feature of NYT, and make the whole bundle **100% free.**

## Phase II
**Then, TV.** The next step is to **use AI to generate a CNN-type show in any language directly from the X feed.** Elon can buy legacy stations or strike deals for distribution, and then play it 24/7 in airports, lounges, and wherever CNN's fake news is shown. Starlink probably helps there, and X TV will likely be much cheaper to produce per minute than CNN.

## Phase III
**Next, new creators.** In a sense both the proposed X newspaper and X TV channel are really just reformatting the feed. They are just alternative clients for X, for more passive news consumers who still listen to legacy newspapers and TV. But the mere existence of these channels will stimulate new, higher quality kinds of content creation, as people seek to have their content highlighted on the frontpage of X News or in the X TV channel.

Moreover, an X newspaper and X TV station would be far more egalitarian than legacy New York media, as X would publish people from all over and be AI-localized to every language. Again, it'd also be free, as the Tesla/SpaceX empire is more valuable than NYT/CNN, and could cross-subsidize if need be.

So: X has established a beachhead, and can now play to win. Elon could replace Sulzberger-style nepotism with dispassionate algorithms. **Just take the X feed and transform it with AI to defeat NYT and CNN on their home turf.**

## Example
To show feasibility, here's a prototype for generating an AI newspaper directly from a social feed. Check out the source code[^1], the spec[^2], and the site itself[^3].

I can do this!
