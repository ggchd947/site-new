## Introduction
Naval Ravikant is the CEO and co-founder of [AngelList](https://www.angellist.com/). He's invested in more than 100 companies, including Uber, Twitter, Yammer, and many others. Naval is an incredibly deep thinker who challenges the status quo on so many things.


## Ideas
1. If you don't know yet what you should work on, the most important thing is to figure it out.

2. Books make for great friends, because the best thinkers of the last few thousand years tell you their nuggets of wisdom.

3. You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.

4. To make an original contribution, you have to be irrationally obsessed with something.

5. The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet.

6. Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.

7. Fortunes require leverage.

8. Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgment.

9. Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.

10. Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now. Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.

11. Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.

12. Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.

13. If you're not 100% into it, somebody else who is 100% into it will outperform you. And they won't just outperform you by a little bit - they'll outperform you by a lot because now we're operating in the domain of ideas, compound interest really applies and leverage really applies.

14. Technology democratizes consumption but consolidates production. The best person in the world at anything gets to do it for everyone.

15. Escape competition through authenticity.

16. If you are fundamentally building and marketing something that is an extension of who you are, no one can compete with you on that.

17. When I talk about specific knowledge, I mean figure out what you were doing as a kid or teenager almost effortlessly. Something you didn't even consider a skill, but people around you noticed. Your mother or your best friend growing up would know.

18. The more you know, the less you [diversify](https://medium.com/bullacademy/the-more-knowledgeable-you-are-the-less-you-diversify-8f02f2266977)

19. The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed. They are creative expressions of continuous learners in free markets.

20. Whenever you can in life, optimize for independence rather than pay.

21. You decide it's important to you. You prioritize it above everything else. You read everything on the topic.

22. The really smart thinkers are clear thinkers. They understand the basics at a very, very fundamental level.

23. The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner.

24. If you're evenly split on a difficult decision, take the path more painful in the short term.

25. What are the most efficient ways to build new mental models? Read a lot - just read.

26. I probably read one to two hours a day. That puts me in the top 0.00001 percent. I think that alone accounts for any material success I've had in my life and any intelligence I might have.

27. In the intellectual domain, compound interest rules.

28. All the real scorecards are internal.

29. A calm mind, a fit body, and a house full of love. These things cannot be bought. They must be earned.

30. Your real resume is just a catalog of all your suffering. If I ask you to describe your real life to yourself, and you look back from your deathbed at the interesting things you've done, it's all going to be around the sacrifices you made, the hard things you did.

31. What you want in life is to be in control of your time.

32. Being at the extreme in your art is very important in the age of leverage.

33. Enjoy yourself. Do something positive. Project some love. Make someone happy. Laugh a little bit. Appreciate the moment. And do you work.
