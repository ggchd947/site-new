### What is a Loser?
The simplest definition of a loser is when somebody, forced under truth serum to talk about themselves, says completely different things from what they say not under truth serum.

That's a loser.

Somebody who says "Look man, somethings aren't great in my life blah blah blah", that's not a loser. The loser is the kind of person who says one thing but believes another.

"Well, that's just a liar"

No, there are some liars who are winners and some who are losers.

I mean someone who projects an identity.

### How to STOP being a LOSER
The only way to not be a loser is to be true to yourself.
