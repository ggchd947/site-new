Discounts and sales tax are often computed based on a percentage:
- First convert each percent to a decimal by dividing by 100%.
- Multiply the regular price of the item by the decimal value for the discount. This is the amount of the discount.
- Subtract the amount of the discount from the regular price. This is the sale price.
- If there is more than one item, add the sale prices together to get the subtotal.
- Multiply the subtotal by the decimal value for the tax. This is the amount of the tax.
- Add the amount of the tax to the subtotal. This is the total cost.

#### Example 1.
A backpack has a regular price of $20 in a state that does not charge a sales tax. A customer has a coupon for 35% off. What is the total cost of the purchase?

- Convert the discount rate to a decimal: 
$$
\frac{35%}{100%} = 0.35
$$ 
- Multiply \\$20 by 0.35 to get the amount of the discount: 
$$
{0.35 \cdot $20 = $7}
$$
- Subtract \\$7 from \\$20 to get the sale price:
$$
{$20 - $7 = $13}
$$
- Since there is no tax, **$13 is the total cost.**

#### Example 2.
A gallon of milk is priced at $4.50. It is not on sale. There is a sales tax of 4% on groceries. What is the total cost of the purchase?

- Convert the tax rate to a decimal: 
$$
\frac{4%}{100%} = 0.04
$$ 
- Multiply \\$4.5 by 0.04 to get the amount of the tax: 
$$
{0.04 \cdot $4.5 = $0.18}
$$
- Add \\$0.18 to \\$4.5 to get the total cost:
$$
{$4.5 + $0.18 = $4.68}
$$
- **$4.68 is the total cost.**

#### Example 3.
A magnetic dry erase board has a regular price of $150. It is on sale for 20% off. There is a sales tax of 8%. What is the total cost of the purchase?

- Convert the discount and tax rates to  decimals: 
$$
\frac{20%}{100%} = 0.2,\frac{8}{100%} = 0.08
$$
- Multiply \\$150 by 0.2 to get the amount of the discount: 
$$
{0.2 \cdot $150 = $30}
$$
- Subtract \\$30 to \\$150 to get the sale price:
$$
{$150 - $30 = $120}
$$
- Multiply \\$120 by 0.08 to get the amount of the tax: 
$$
{0.08 \cdot $120 = $9.6}
$$
- Add \\$9.6 to \\$120 to get the total cost:
$$
{$120 + $9.6 = $129.6}
$$
- **$129.6 is the total cost.**
