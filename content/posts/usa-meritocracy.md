People don't want to admit it but the USA is a meritocracy.

If you have:
- energy / work ethic
- a sense of urgency
- communication skills
- ability to lead / delegate

You will get rich.

Any background, any cit or town, any culture, any race.

People know it but don't want to admit it because it takes away their excuses and makes them feel worse about their failures.
