Whenever you see "contact sales" there's likely a better option elsewhere.

Companies put that when they either want to price discriminate (which should be illegal) or when they believe they need a person to get you to convert.

Don't do business with losers, just say no.

"hi I'd like to buy an X"

"oh sweet, how much money do you have?"

This is a deep cultural problem in American business, and one of the reasons many prefer to work with Chinese suppliers. Everyone is losing out because of this.

Companies should determine the profit they are okay with and post that price. This rot needs to be ripped out.
