Whether or not people want to admit it - high value men & women are often treated far worse than their mid counterparts.

There happens a weird mental reaction where most people will dehumanize these people in order to cope with their feelings of intimidation or envy or jealousy or what it may be.

This happens in several ways, it happens across gender - where women will often dehumanize high value men in order to cope, these men are viewed as different than other men, they instantly become viewed as potential romantic partners, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it may often lead to unaligned perspectives & jealousy, such as becoming friendly with the man and then feeling betrayed and upset or jealous that he also talks to other girls or has other female friends, so they'll tell themselves "hes just a player" or whatever it may be, not considering that maybe he just has several platonic female friends or whatever, and none of those emotions would have been there if the man was just a mid.

The same goes vice versa as well - the large majority of men objectify women physically at a high level, so when a woman is attractive enough then most men will dehumanize her in their mind, they don't view her as a woman anymore, but an object of desire, they don't want to view her as a human with emotions and thoughts, etc - they just think about how beautiful she is and how other men must desire her as well or similar & thus don't emotionally connect on a deeper level out of fear of rejection or abandonment or etc, it's much simpler to assume that she is an object of beauty rather than one of conscious being.

And finally it is especially true within the genders - men will dehumanize high value men to incredible degrees, they don't feel sympathy or empathy for them because 'they have it good'
"why should high value men deserve my sympathy" think the mid men" - "he can get any girl he wants, he should just be grateful" typa vibe.

same for women, perhaps even worse than with the men, women can be very catty & I have experienced several different scenarios where a woman who was smart and beautiful and kind was bullied by her peers out of jealousy & envy. It happens a lot more often than you think, the mid women will tell themselves that she deserves it, "who does she think she is? - she thinks she's better than us" etc - even though the woman might have never been arrogant towards her peers at all, it's simply just the aura she gives off that makes them seethe.

TLDR-
the aura of both high value men & women is intimidating, often causing these people to become very lonely unless they are able to find suitable peers who can match their level of value.

People will view you as their rival or competition, even though you don't view them as one and don't want to - they can't help it, they view you as a threat to them in the dating market or whatever other popularity markets they obsess over.

You will be constantly judged for everything you do
- too quiet or too busy? "he's so arrogant & stuck up he thinks he's too good to talk with the rest of us"
- in a downward spiral or depression? "he deserves it, that's what he gets for thinking he's better than us"

etc, continues across many aspects, many times you might feel like you can't catch a break because these people will actively cheer for your downfall as they hope that they can supersede you in value.
