if you're having trouble getting hired, it's because you're not dangerous enough. **become dangerous**. you need to be **singularly capable** of taking down a 1b valued company. it's not even that hard. become dangerous

getting hired should be a choice you make yourself. are you an electrical/aerospace engineer waiting to become a fat ass lockheed martin lifer? or are you someone who is going to **become capable** of remotely blowing shit up, who gets bought out by lockhead for 8 digits?

stop waiting for the world to happen to you, start becoming dangerous

BECOME DANGEROUS

SKILL THE FUCK UP

BUILD USEFUL SHIT

BECOME UNDENIABLE
