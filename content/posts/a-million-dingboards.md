### @yacineMTB
it's very amusing to watch people do this and then realize "damn this is actually not that easy"

this is actually a really good exercise on UIs and how to design them. particularly how to manage state and events that transform that state

I get so filled with love when I see a dingboard clone.

genuinely I think it can be a million dollar app if done right so it's quite literally the one piece in raftel. **I left it there go find it!**
