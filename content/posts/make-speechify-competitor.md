### Things to improve
- I don't appreciate getting conversion hacked, I'm going to make sure to cancel yearly on the three day free trial *because* I know I'm being conversion hacked. Autists really hate it.
- My threat model does not allow a chrome extension to read everything. It needs permissions to see only on deliberate user action. I also need to actually be able to audit the code myself. (Solution: whitelist by URL)
- Use better voices
- Use computer vision only. Ignore all text parsing.
