### Conversation
**@archived_videos:** Genuine question, how to train your ability to see markets? I guess meeting more people would be one, doing more stuff another

1. Literally anything is possible. You either need to **skill up** to the point where you are capable of building anything at all. Or, you just need to believe.
2. You need things. There are things that you wish existed. **Just build that**
3. Market it.

You have to think of it as an engineering problem. There is an event that you are trying to maximize. Honestly, one of the main reasons I got so good at this was reading the analyses of godlike conversion engineers at Stripe. As a result I now know it in my bones.

My repos folder on my afternoon laptop has like 2-3 things right now that I could launch and run a successful startup off of. Honestly after dingboard I realized how easy it was and kind of stopped feeling the urgency. It's so easy that I can do it anytime I decide to.

This took me 3 hours on a Saturday. I could blow out every single 8 digit VTuber company with this. It wouldn't even be that hard.

We are kind of in a dot com internet moment right now. Except we already have the internet. It's on steroids.

I wish ya'll knew how easy it was.
