None of my intelligent (130+ IQ) friends listen to music regularly. They only listen selectively and rarely e.g. at a business event or a classical piece, but almost never listen spontaneously in their own time. This has been a long term consistent observation, but today confirmation came. A new meta-analysis showed time listening to music per day increases exponentially with lower IQ, with drop off to near 0 minutes at 145+. Music is mostly appealing as a way to fill an otherwise vacant mind that has no interesting thoughts and minimal goal-directed behavior. Intelligent people find stimulation from thinking about problems and doing things, not from marinading in vaguely pleasant sounds like a soggy potato sitting in oil in a dirty oven tray


People hate scientific findings like these because it threatens their ego

- They falsely see themselves as smart
- They listen to music
- Studies say opposite
- Cope apocalypse ensues. Funnily, it directly proves low IQ by their inability to understand n=1 VS population results


Just as funny are gloats in the opposite direction too

- Hasn’t listened to music lately
- (Or maybe has, but nobody knows)
- QTs or comments that they haven’t listened to music in years, and delightedly lets everyone infer the implications of unquestionable supreme intelligence

To anyone persistently arguing with science, I also recommend listening to music

I’m sure it won’t take more than 2 minutes of listening to your favorite Taylor Swift songs before you forget all about this and shift back into the braindead delusional slumber you call your “life”

If you are too lazy to read the studies the fastest way to learn the average IQs of heavy-duty music listeners is to read the QTs/replies on the original thread. My DMs are also a potent insight. It’s natural to want to silence your mind with music if it is so full of bitterness and hate.
