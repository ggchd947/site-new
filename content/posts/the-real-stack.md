few people cross between the CS/EE/MechE worlds.

with robotics ascendant, spend time with at least one of those 3 fields outside their own (MechE in my case)

that triple threat is sometimes like a superpower, because now you're a system of systems person, and can design just about anything you want

learn the fabrication side.

learn CS infra, EE physical design and assembly, and things like 3D printing, machining, welding, and other processes.

now you at least know how to DFM (design for manufacturing).

to top it off, learn something about manufacturing itself. BOMS, supply chain, provisioning, etc.

you call yourself full-stack? what I just described is the real stack.
