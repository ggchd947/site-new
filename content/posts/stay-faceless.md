become faceless, stay faceless, resist temptation

## A Manifesto

In a world obsessed with selfies and social media stardom, this advice is your shield and your sword. Ancient cultures warned: a photo steals your soul. In the A.I age, it's worse. Your face becomes data, biometrics, numbers, ripe for manipulation and exploitation. Instead, **choose power through obscurity.**

Facelessness **isn't** anonymity. It's a **calculated mystique**. You're known, but not seen. Heard, but not exposed. Your reputation precedes you, but your image remains elusive. It's akin to being the wizard behind the curtain --- your presence is felt, but your image remains obscure.

By staying faceless, you dodge the bullet of social status warfare. No flexing. No location tags. No designer label flaunting. You rise above the petty competitions that drain souls and bank accounts. You avoid falling into the traps of being caught in mimetic rivalry, you avoid chasing status for the sake of chasing status. The Joneses can't touch you when they can't see you. They don't even know your government name.

The option to be "doxxed" is still your card to hold. You weaponize morbid curiosity. Think Banksy, Daft Punk, Kubrick. Your facelessness becomes your face, a brand built on intrigue.

Freedom is wealth. No tribe owns you. No cult claims you. Your identity is fluid, a chameleon's dream. You choose your myth, your legend. You are the author of your own mystery. In the age of deepfakes and digital doppelgangers, your facelessness is your fortress. You control your digital destiny, unburdened by the ever-watchful eye of the internet mob. Your lack of a face becomes a face, it becomes its own brand. When people finally meet you in the flesh, they will feel special, chosen.

Fame? It's glorified harassment from normies. Random strangers feeling entitled to your time, your space, your life. You sidestep this bullet, letting your work absorb the spotlight while you bask in the shadows and the glory.
